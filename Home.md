Welcome to the oresat-structure wiki! This is the go-to guide for contributing to the OreSat project.

## Downloading the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your system<be>

> `git clone https://github.com/oresat/oresat-structure.git`
> 
> **NOTE:** The repository is around 9GB in size. If you would not like to download the entire repository history, use the following command instead<be>
> 
> `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/oresat/oresat-structure.git`
> * The --depth 1 flag indicates that only the most recent commit will be cloned
> 
> To also clone all branches, use the following command<be>
> 
> `git clone --depth 1 --no-single-branch https://github.com/oresat/oresat-structure.git`
> * the --no-single-branch flag indicates that all branches should be cloned (since --depth automatically runs --single-branch)
